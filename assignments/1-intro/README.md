# Assignment 1: Intro

This should take you all of five minutes.

First, create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com). Don't worry — it's free! If you do anything that requires putting in a credit card number, you did it wrong.

Second, we need to figure out what version of Python you're using. That requires two steps:

First, open up a tool called Terminal by clicking on the magnifying glass at the upper right of your screen (on a Mac) and typing the word "Terminal":

You'll be confronted by a blank prompt that looks kinda like the screenshot below (though it might be white). Once you're there, type the word `python` — like the snake. All lowercase.

See where it says "Python 3.7.4"? Find the corresponding version number on yours and write it down. It'll either start with a 2 or a 3. If you can't get it to work, that's fine too.

Finally **put both a link to you Github account and the version number in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1omWnBWpSUVYUD10qOjZ3vYEj-YFYLbwXBJPpBahbDqU/edit)**.

Bingo. You're done. Due **Wednesday, Sept. 11**.
