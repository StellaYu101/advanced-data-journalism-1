# Assignment 2: Installation test

This should be an easy one. In fact, the only way you can mess up this assignment is if you don't do it. Its purpose is to make sure the software you need for class is properly installed on your machine, while at the same time doing some basic review of git and command line commands.

The assignment assumes you've installed the course software per the [installation instructions](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/class-software.md), so if you haven't yet, that would be a good place to start.

Once that's ready, just follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. (`git clone https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism.git`)

2. Using the command line, navigate into the `advanced-data-journalism/assignments/2-installation` directory of the repository. Hint: use `cd` commands.

3. Activate your virtual environment. The install guide suggests you call it `dataj` but if you used another name, that's fine: `workon dataj`

4. Run the `installation_test.py` file. Note that for this to work, you'll need to be in the same directory as the file on the command line (see step 3): `python installation_test.py`

5. If you get any errors at any step along the way — and some of you will — send them to me via email, preferably with a screenshot of your terminal window indicating the error: chase.davis@gmail.com

If everything goes as expected, your output should look like this:

When you're done, mark in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1omWnBWpSUVYUD10qOjZ3vYEj-YFYLbwXBJPpBahbDqU/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=116462374319624048534) whether the installation was successful or not. This assignment is due by the end of class on **Wednesday, Sept. 11.** It should only take 5 minutes.
