# Documenting a scraper

Your task this time is pretty simple: Just take the scraper in this folder, and, using comments, explain in your own words what you think every line of the code is doing.

The idea here is that everything in this code in some ways flows from the basics we've already discussed: data types, loops, if/else statements, objects, methods, etc. So even if not every line in the code makes total sense, you've probably got at least a good guess about what it does. And that's ok! We don't expect you to know everything.

It might be helpful at times to consult the documentation for [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [mechanize](https://mechanize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) â€” the two external libraries used in the code. [This guide](https://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) might also be useful (hint hint).

Once you're done, commit your code into either a new or existing repository and put a link to it in the spreadsheet, per usual.

This assignment is due *next Monday, Oct. 14**.
